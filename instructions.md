Below is a complete MVP design specification document for a “gesture‑driven presentation” application built with React, React Flow, and MediaPipe. This document is written so that someone with no prior exposure to the project can read it and build the project from scratch. It covers the overall architecture, user stories, individual components, interactions, and design specifications.

# MVP Design Specification Document  
**Project Title:** Gesture‑Driven Presentation Controller  
**Tech Stack:**  
- **Frontend Framework:** React  
- **Flow Editor & Node Mapping:** React Flow  
- **Gesture Recognition:** MediaPipe Gesture Recognizer (Web version)  
- **Optional Persistence:** Browser localStorage (with possibility for a lightweight backend later)

---

## 1. Project Overview

The application’s goal is to allow a presenter (or a user) to configure and control a presentation using physical hand gestures. The system has two main modules:  
- **Gesture Recognition Module:** Uses the webcam to capture hand movements and recognizes gestures (swipe, pinch, open/closed fist, etc.) via MediaPipe.  
- **Workflow Editor (Mapping UI):** A drag‑and‑drop, node‑based interface built with React Flow. In this editor, the user can define screens (nodes) and visually connect them with arrows (edges) that represent gestures. Each connection maps a specific gesture to an action (e.g., next slide, zoom in, API call).  

The MVP covers the essential features required to capture gestures, allow a user to define a presentation flow, and then control the presentation using the detected gestures.

## 2. User Stories

**User Story 1: Setup and Calibration**  
- As a new user, I want to run a calibration procedure so that the system can accurately recognize my hand gestures.  
- The system will provide a short “learn” or calibration mode (using MediaPipe’s built‑in configuration) to adjust thresholds (confidence, tracking) for my webcam and lighting conditions.

**User Story 2: Creating the Presentation Flow**  
- As a presenter, I want to create a workflow that represents the sequence of slides or screens in my presentation.  
- I can drag “node” components (each representing a slide/screen) from a palette and drop them onto a grid or canvas.  
- I can then draw connections (edges) between nodes. Each connection is annotated with a gesture label (e.g., “swipe right” for next slide).

**User Story 3: Mapping Gestures to Actions**  
- For every connection (or directly on a node), I want to assign an action that the application will trigger when the gesture is detected.  
- Actions include: transitioning to the next or previous slide, zooming into a section, calling an external API, or triggering a multimedia change.

**User Story 4: Real-Time Gesture Control During Presentation**  
- When I am presenting, I want the system to continuously capture video from the webcam, process hand gestures via MediaPipe, and automatically trigger the mapped action.  

**User Story 5: Persistence and Reload**  
- I want my configured workflow (nodes, connections, and gesture-action mappings) to be saved and reloaded automatically on future visits.  
- For the MVP, persistence can be handled using browser localStorage.

## 3. System Architecture & Component Overview

### A. **Frontend Application (React)**
- **Main Components:**
  - **App Container:** The top‑level component that manages global state (e.g., active mode: edit vs. presentation) and routing if needed.
  - **Workflow Editor:** Implements the drag‑and‑drop configuration UI using React Flow.
  - **Gesture Recognition View:** A component that displays the live webcam feed, and processes gestures via MediaPipe
  - **Configuration Panels:** Panels or modals to adjust settings (e.g., calibration, gesture mapping details, node properties).
  - **Persistence Manager:** A service module that saves and loads workflow configuration (using localStorage and, optionally, a backend API).

### B. **Gesture Recognition Module (MediaPipe)**
- **Key Features:**
  - Integrates with the webcam (using standard browser APIs or a React Webcam component).
  - Runs MediaPipe’s Gesture Recognizer in “live stream” mode.
  - Configurable thresholds: runningMode, numHands, min_hand_detection_confidence, etc.
  - Outputs recognized gesture categories and confidence scores.
- **Integration Approach:**
  - Wrap MediaPipe initialization and recognition calls in a React hook (e.g., useGestureRecognizer) that periodically processes frames and updates a global gesture state.
  - Provide callback props to send recognized gestures to the controller logic.

### C. **Workflow Editor (React Flow)**
- **Key Elements:**
  - **Nodes:** Each node represents a slide or a screen. Nodes are draggable, configurable, and have an editable title.
    - **Specifications:**
      - **Dimensions:** Fixed minimum size (e.g., 200×120 px) with responsiveness.
      - **Properties:** Unique ID, title (editable via inline text input), optional description.
      - **Style:** Rounded corners, drop shadow, and color-coded based on type (e.g., presentation node, action node).
  - **Edges:** Represent gesture-to-action mappings.
    - **Specifications:**
      - **Label:** Each edge displays a small label (e.g., “Swipe Right”) indicating the recognized gesture.
      - **Behavior:** Edges are connectable only between defined connection points (e.g., “terminal” points on the node). You may configure “connection validation” rules (using React Flow’s API) so that only allowed gesture mappings are possible.
  - **Toolbar / Palette:** A sidebar listing available nodes and common actions.
    - **Functionality:** Drag items from the palette to the canvas to create nodes. Possibly include a “trash” area for deletion.
  - **Property Panel:** When a node or edge is selected, a panel appears allowing the user to edit properties such as:
    - For nodes: title, background color, associated content (e.g., slide media URL).
    - For edges: gesture type, associated action (from a pre‑defined list: Next, Previous, Zoom, Custom API call).

### D. **Application Modes**
- **Edit Mode:**  
  The workflow editor is active. Users can add, edit, reposition, and connect nodes. All changes are saved (persisted) in localStorage.
- **Presentation Mode:**  
  The editor UI is hidden. The application loads the saved workflow and then listens to the gesture recognition module. When a gesture is recognized, the application looks up the corresponding node/edge mapping and triggers a transition (e.g., moves to the target slide).

## 4. Detailed Feature Specifications

### 4.1. Gesture Recognition Module Specifications

- **Input:**  
  - Video feed from the user’s webcam.
  - Configuration parameters (e.g., runningMode: LIVE_STREAM, num_hands: 1 or 2, min_hand_detection_confidence: 0.5).
- **Processing Pipeline:**  
  1. **Frame Acquisition:** Capture frames at a target frame rate (e.g., 30 FPS) via the React Webcam component.
  2. **MediaPipe Inference:** Process each frame using the MediaPipe Gesture Recognizer.
  3. **Gesture Classification:**  
     - Output a result object containing gesture categories (e.g., “Swipe_Right”, “Thumbs_Up”), landmark data (if needed), and confidence scores.
  4. **Callback Mechanism:**  
     - If a gesture is recognized with confidence above a threshold (e.g., 0.7), call a callback function (provided as a prop) to update the global gesture state.
- **Output:**  
  - Current recognized gesture (string identifier).
  - Timestamp and possibly an overlay indicator on the video feed.

### 4.2. Workflow Editor (React Flow) Specifications

- **Canvas Specifications:**  
  - **Dimensions:** Full viewport width/height or fixed container (responsive design).  
  - **Grid:** Optional grid lines (light opacity) to help with alignment.
  - **Zoom & Pan:** Enable zooming (via mouse wheel) and panning (via drag on empty canvas).
- **Node Details:**  
  - **Properties:**  
    - ID (auto‑generated).  
    - Title (editable inline, default “Slide X”).  
    - Content reference (e.g., image URL or slide note).  
    - Connection points:  
      - Outgoing terminal(s) (e.g., on the right side for “next” actions).  
      - Incoming terminal(s) (e.g., on the left side).
  - **Design:**  
    - Use React Flow’s custom node renderer.  
    - Style: Use CSS or inline styles with a modern flat design.
- **Edge (Connection) Details:**  
  - **Properties:**  
    - Source node and target node IDs.  
    - Label representing the gesture that triggers the connection.  
    - Action type (a function pointer or identifier for “Next Slide”, “Zoom In”, etc.).
  - **Behavior:**  
    - Allow edges to be drawn only between compatible terminals.  
    - Provide an “edit” dialog (e.g., via a double-click) to change the edge’s label or action mapping.
- **Toolbar/Palette:**  
  - A sidebar with a list of available node types (e.g., “Slide Node”, “Action Node” if needed).  
  - Drag‑and‑drop support to add a new node on the canvas.
  - A “Reset” or “Clear” button to remove all nodes/edges.
- **Property Panel:**  
  - When a node or edge is selected, open a side panel or modal with a form:
    - For nodes: Editable title, content URL, color picker.
    - For edges: Dropdown list of gestures (e.g., Swipe Left, Swipe Right, Pinch, etc.) and a dropdown for action type (e.g., Next, Previous, Custom Action).
- **Save/Load Workflow:**  
  - Automatically save the current workflow state (nodes, edges, and properties) in localStorage after each change.
  - On application start, load from localStorage if data exists.
  - Option to “Export” the workflow as JSON and “Import” from JSON for backup.

### 4.3. Presentation Mode Specifications

- **Initialization:**  
  - On switching to Presentation Mode, hide the editor UI elements (toolbar, property panel) and display the workflow as a full‑screen presentation.
- **Slide Transitions:**  
  - The application listens to the gesture recognition state.
  - When a gesture is received (e.g., “Swipe_Right”), find the corresponding outgoing edge from the current node.
  - Trigger a transition animation (e.g., fade out/in, slide transition) to the target node.
- **Interruption Handling:**  
  - Debounce rapid gesture inputs to prevent accidental multiple transitions.
  - Provide a “back” gesture mapping to return to the previous slide if desired.

### 4.4. Calibration and Settings Panel Specifications

- **Calibration Mode:**  
  - A startup modal instructing the user to position their hand within a given area.  
  - Option to “Learn Skin Color” or adjust lighting settings.
  - Display test gesture recognition results in real time (e.g., a debug overlay showing landmark points).
- **Settings:**  
  - Adjust MediaPipe configuration parameters (e.g., confidence thresholds).  
  - Choose gesture-to-action mappings from a preset list.
  - Reset to default configuration button.

### 4.5. Technical and Design Constraints

- **Responsiveness:**  
  - The UI should work on desktop and tablet devices (responsive design using CSS Flexbox/Grid).
  - Node positions should be stored relative to the canvas container to adapt to screen size changes.
- **Performance:**  
  - Ensure the MediaPipe module runs on a separate thread if possible (using Web Workers) to avoid UI blocking.
  - Lazy-load components as needed (e.g., the workflow editor loads only when entering Edit Mode).
- **Accessibility:**  
  - Use semantic HTML for key UI elements.
  - Provide keyboard navigation in the workflow editor.
  - Ensure that color choices meet contrast standards.
- **Documentation & Comments:**  
  - Code should be commented, and a README should be provided that explains setup, usage, and build instructions.
- **Testing:**  
  - Create unit tests for the React components.
  - Manually test the gesture recognition module in different lighting and backgrounds.

## 5. User Interface Wireframes & Flow Diagrams

While this document is text‑based, here are descriptions for creating the wireframes:

### A. **Landing / Calibration Screen**
- **Elements:**  
  - Full‑screen video feed from the webcam.  
  - “Calibration” overlay with instructions (“Place your hand within the frame to calibrate”).  
  - “Start Presentation” button (disabled until calibration completes).

### B. **Workflow Editor Screen (Edit Mode)**
- **Elements:**  
  - Left Sidebar: Palette listing node types and a list of gestures.
  - Main Canvas: React Flow canvas with a grid background.
  - Top Bar: Buttons for “Save”, “Load”, “Switch to Presentation Mode”, and “Reset Workflow”.
  - Right Sidebar: Property panel that opens when a node or edge is selected.
- **Flow:**  
  - User drags a node from the palette to the canvas, positions it, and double‑clicks to edit its title.  
  - User draws an edge from one node’s “out” point to another node’s “in” point, then double‑clicks the edge to choose a gesture and action mapping.

### C. **Presentation Mode Screen**
- **Elements:**  
  - Full‑screen presentation view showing the current slide (node).  
  - Minimal UI overlay: Current slide title, and a small notification area for recognized gestures.
- **Flow:**  
  - The system listens in the background for gestures. On gesture recognition, an animated transition occurs to the next or previous slide.

## 6. Data Flow & API Contracts

### A. **Gesture Recognition Data Flow**
1. **Input:** Video Frame from Webcam → MediaPipe Gesture Recognizer  
2. **Output:** Gesture Result Object  
   ```json
   {
     "gesture": "Swipe_Right",
     "confidence": 0.85,
     "timestamp": 1672531200000
   }
   ```
3. **Callback:** The recognition hook calls a function such as `onGestureDetected(gestureResult)`.

### B. **Workflow State (Saved as JSON)**
- **Example JSON:**
  ```json
  {
    "nodes": [
      { "id": "node1", "title": "Slide 1", "position": {"x": 100, "y": 150}, "contentUrl": "slide1.jpg" },
      { "id": "node2", "title": "Slide 2", "position": {"x": 400, "y": 150}, "contentUrl": "slide2.jpg" }
    ],
    "edges": [
      { "id": "edge1", "source": "node1", "target": "node2", "gesture": "Swipe_Right", "action": "nextSlide" }
    ]
  }
  ```
- **Persistence:** This JSON is stored in localStorage under a key such as `"presentationWorkflow"`.
